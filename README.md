# ðŸ“ˆ Term Deposit Subscription Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The objective is to improve the efficiency of marketing campaigns by identifying high-potential customers ahead of time, reducing cost, and improving conversion rates.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI)
- **Goal**: Predict customer response (`yes`/`no`) to a term deposit offer
- **Techniques**:
  - KMeans Clustering for behavioral segmentation
  - XGBoost Classification for final prediction
  - SMOTE for class imbalance correction
  - SHAP for model explainability
- **Performance**: ~95.3% Accuracy, Balanced Precision & Recall

---

## ML Pipeline Summary

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - One-hot encoding
   - Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
   - Missing value imputation (mean)
2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - KMeans Clustering + PCA (for cluster labeling)
3. **Balancing**
   - SMOTE to handle class imbalance
4. **Modeling**
   - XGBoost Classifier (final model)
   - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
5. **Explainability**
   - SHAP values and feature importance
6. **Models**
   - Cluster model (`.joblib`)
   - XGBoost model (`.joblib`)
   - Scaler object (`.joblib`)

## Deployment Strategy

This project is deployed using containerized and GitOps principles:

### 1. **Containerization**
- All model files (`XGBoost`, `KMeans`, `Scaler`) are saved and bundled in a **Docker container**.
- A lightweight **Flask API** is created to:
  - Accept input data
  - Scale and assign clusters
  - Predict using XGBoost
  - Return the result in real-time

```bash
# Example Dockerfile snippet
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
