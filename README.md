# Term Deposit Subscription Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The objective is to improve the efficiency of marketing campaigns by identifying high-potential customers ahead of time, reducing cost, and improving conversion rates.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI)
- **Goal**: Predict customer response (yes/no) to a term deposit offer

### Techniques:
- KMeans Clustering for behavioral segmentation  
- XGBoost Classification for final prediction  
- SMOTE for class imbalance correction  
- SHAP for model explainability  

**Performance**: ~95.3% Accuracy, Balanced Precision & Recall

## ML Pipeline Summary

### Data Preprocessing
- One-hot encoding  
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)  
- Missing value imputation (mean)  

### Unsupervised Learning
- KMeans Clustering + PCA (for cluster labeling)  

### Balancing
- SMOTE to handle class imbalance  

### Modeling
- XGBoost Classifier (final model)  
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  

### Explainability
- SHAP values and feature importance  

## Models
- Cluster model (`.joblib`)  
- XGBoost model (`.joblib`)  
- Scaler object (`.joblib`)

## Deployment Strategy

This project is deployed using containerized and GitOps principles:

### 1. Dependency Management
All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Example:

flask
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xgboost
joblib
gunicorn

### 2. Containerization
All model files (XGBoost, KMeans, Scaler) are saved and bundled in a Docker container.  
A lightweight Flask API is created to:
- Accept input data  
- Scale and assign clusters  
- Predict using XGBoost  
- Return the result in real-time  

#### Example Dockerfile snippet:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]

Build and Push Docker Image

3. Kubernetes Deployment

Sample deployment.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ml-deposit-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ml-deposit
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ml-deposit
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ml-container
        image: your-docker-username/ml-term-deposit-app
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000

Sample service.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ml-deposit-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: ml-deposit
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 5000

4. Argo CD Integration

We use Argo CD for GitOps-style Continuous Deployment:
	•	Argo CD monitors the GitHub repo for changes to Kubernetes YAML files.
	•	On every commit to the main branch (e.g., image tag update), it syncs and redeploys the app automatically.
	•	This ensures CI/CD without manual intervention.

This setup makes the model production-ready, scalable, and maintainable with modern DevOps and MLOps practices.

You can copy and paste this directly into your `README.md`. Let me know if you’d like to include badges, repo structure, or instructions to run locally!
